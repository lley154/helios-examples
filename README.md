### [Cardano Smart Contracts with Helios](https://a.co/d/cgw5XPC)
#### Author: Lawrence Ley B.Sc.

The book is focused on making the onboarding experience for new developers to Cardano as easy and as straightforward as possible.  There is a lot of ground to cover so we start from the basics and go all the way to more sophisticated real world examples including both on-chain and off-chain code.  We wrap up the book with blockchain monitoring, troubleshooting techniques and production readiness.

Please consider buying the book if you want to get more insights into the examples and to help support the author and a donation the Helios project.
